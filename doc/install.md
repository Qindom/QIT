## Installing qindomClient

---

1. Make sure you have python 3.7.0 or greater (or else python 2.7).

    See [Installing Python 3](https://docs.python-guide.org/) @ the hitchhiker's guide to python.

2. Use `pip` to install `qindomClient`:

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install qindomClient
    ```
    
### Disclaimer

-  **qit is currently in alpha.** We are still making breaking changes, and we *will* break your code when we make new releases. We recommend that you pin a specific version of qindomClient in `requirements.txt` files, and periodically bump to the latest release. That way you have control over when a breaking change affects you.
